## Your Task
Extract true business entities from attached repo to document:

- Core business data structures and entities across any industry
- Entity relationships and cardinality patterns
- Business attributes and data definitions
- Data architecture supporting business operations
- Entity relationship diagram (SVG format)

You have to pick the codebase from the 00.phase-1-input folder of the attached repo.

## Analysis Approach

### Core Principle: Business Data vs Technical Data
✅ **INCLUDE: True Business Entities**
Business entities represent real-world concepts that exist in the business domain:

**Universal Business Entity Patterns:**

### **PERSONAS**: People, Organizations, or Roles
**Definition**: People, organizations, or roles that interact with the business system
**Examples**: Users, Customers, Employees, Vendors, Patients, Students, Administrators, Partners, Contractors
**Key Characteristics**:
- Represent human actors or organizational entities that interact with the business
- Have identity, roles, and permissions within the business context
- Drive business activities and decision-making processes
- Can be internal (employees, admins, operators) or external (customers, vendors, partners)
- Often have authentication, authorization, and access control requirements
- Participate in business processes and workflows

**Business Recognition Test**: "Is this a person, group, or role that business stakeholders would recognize as interacting with our operations?"
**Stakeholder Test**: "Would business users care about tracking and managing this type of person or role?"

### **OBJECTS**: Things, Assets, or Resources
**Definition**: Things, assets, or resources the business manages, owns, or controls
**Examples**: Products, Accounts, Policies, Orders, Inventory, Equipment, Contracts, Documents, Assets
**Key Characteristics**:
- Represent business assets with inherent value or operational importance
- Have clear ownership or management relationships ("belongs to" another entity)
- Are actively managed through business processes and lifecycle states
- Generate or support revenue streams and business operations
- Have measurable business impact and operational significance
- Can be physical assets, digital resources, or conceptual business objects

**Ownership Test**: "Does this entity have a clear 'belongs to' relationship with another business entity?"
**Business Asset Test**: "Does the business own, manage, or control this as a valuable resource?"
**Value Test**: "Would losing or mismanaging this entity have measurable business impact?"

### **EVENTS**: Business Activities or Transactions
**Definition**: Business activities, transactions, or processes that occur over time
**Examples**: Purchases, Claims, Appointments, Enrollments, Shipments, Payments, Approvals, Transactions
**Key Characteristics**:
- Represent business activities that happen at specific points in time
- Often trigger changes in other business entities and system states
- Have temporal aspects (start time, end time, duration, sequence)
- Generate business value, operational outcomes, or state changes
- Can be one-time events, recurring processes, or workflow steps
- Often involve multiple personas and objects in coordinated activities

**Activity Test**: "Does this represent something that happens in the business rather than something that exists?"
**Temporal Test**: "Does this have a clear beginning and potentially an end time?"
**Impact Test**: "Does this event cause changes to other business entities or business state?"

### **METADATA**: Business Rules, Classifications, or Organizational Structures
**Definition**: Business rules, classifications, categories, or organizational structures that define how the business operates
**Examples**: Categories, Types, Statuses, Policies, Procedures, Classifications, Hierarchies, Business Rules, Taxonomies
**Key Characteristics**:
- Define how the business organizes, categorizes, and structures information
- Provide meaning, context, and classification to other business entities
- Enable consistent processing, reporting, and business intelligence
- Relatively stable but evolve with changing business needs and requirements
- Support business decision-making through standardized categorization
- Often used for compliance, reporting, and operational consistency

**Classification Test**: "Does this help organize, categorize, or define rules for other business entities?"
**Stability Test**: "Is this relatively stable organizational information rather than transactional data?"
**Structure Test**: "Does this provide meaning or context to other business entities?"

### **RELATIONSHIPS**: Associations Between Business Entities
**Definition**: Associations, connections, or dependencies between different business entities
**Examples**: Ownership, Participation, Dependencies, Hierarchies, Memberships, Associations, Cross-References
**Key Characteristics**:
- Connect two or more business entities in meaningful ways
- Define how entities interact, depend on each other, or relate operationally
- Often represent complex many-to-many relationships requiring explicit modeling
- Enable sophisticated business scenarios and flexible operational models
- Support business scalability and adaptability to changing requirements
- May have their own attributes (relationship dates, status, conditions)

**Connection Test**: "Does this primarily exist to connect or relate other business entities?"
**Complexity Test**: "Does this enable complex business relationships that couldn't be modeled with simple foreign keys?"
**Business Value Test**: "Does this relationship support important business operations or decisions?"

❌ **EXCLUDE: Technical Data Structures**
Technical data that supports system operation but lacks business meaning:

- **System Control Data**: Technical flags, system counters, processing indicators, return codes
- **Technical Metadata**: File headers, system timestamps, technical identifiers without business context
- **Work Areas**: Temporary processing areas, technical work fields, loop counters, array indices
- **System Configuration**: Technical parameters, system settings without business context
- **Processing Artifacts**: Technical processing data, infrastructure logging, connection data
- **Infrastructure Data**: System status, technical audit trails, performance metrics

### Universal 3-Phase Methodology

**Phase 1: Universal Business Discovery**

1. **Business Domain Analysis**
   - Understand the industry vertical and core business purpose
   - Identify primary business functions and capabilities
   - Map business processes from end-to-end
   - Understand business terminology and domain language

2. **Universal Persona Discovery (MANDATORY)**
   - **Internal Personas**: Who works for this organization and uses this system?
   - **External Personas**: Who outside the organization interacts with this system?
   - **System Roles**: What different permission levels/roles exist?
   - **Process Personas**: For each business process, WHO performs it?
   - **Decision Makers**: Who approves, authorizes, or validates business activities?

3. **Universal Business Function Mapping**
   - **Identity Management**: Who/what exists in the business domain?
   - **Resource Management**: What does the business control/own?
   - **Process Execution**: What activities does the business perform?
   - **Relationship Management**: How do entities interact?
   - **Compliance & Control**: What rules govern operations?
   - **Measurement & Reporting**: How does the business track performance?

**Phase 2: Systematic Code Analysis**

**Step 1: Universal Data Structure Pattern Search**

Look for business data structure definitions using universal patterns:
- **Database Tables**: All EXEC SQL DECLARE statements and DCLGEN structures
- **File Structures**: All FILE SECTION record layouts and VSAM definitions
- **Record Structures**: All 01-level COBOL record definitions
- **Shared Structures**: All copybook definitions used across programs
- **Interface Structures**: External system data exchange formats

**Step 2: Universal Field Pattern Recognition**

Search for universal business field patterns:
- **Identifier Fields**: `*-ID`, `*-NUMBER`, `*-CODE`, `*-KEY` (entity identifiers)
- **Descriptive Fields**: `*-NAME`, `*-TITLE`, `*-DESCRIPTION`, `*-LABEL` (entity descriptions)
- **Temporal Fields**: `*-DATE`, `*-TIME`, `*-TIMESTAMP`, `*-PERIOD` (business events)
- **Quantitative Fields**: `*-AMOUNT`, `*-VALUE`, `*-QUANTITY`, `*-COUNT` (business measures)
- **Status Fields**: `*-STATUS`, `*-STATE`, `*-FLAG`, `*-INDICATOR` (business conditions)
- **Classification Fields**: `*-TYPE`, `*-CATEGORY`, `*-CLASS`, `*-GROUP` (business taxonomies)

**Step 3: Universal Business Context Analysis**

Analyze business data usage patterns:
- **Cross-Program Usage**: Data structures used in multiple business programs
- **Business Process Integration**: Data flowing through business workflows
- **Decision Support**: Data used for business decisions and reporting
- **External Interfaces**: Data exchanged with business partners or customers
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Data required for business compliance and auditing

**Phase 3: Universal Entity Validation**

**Universal Business Entity Validation Checklist**

For each potential business entity, validate using these universal criteria:

1. **Business Recognition Test**: "Would a business user in ANY domain recognize this concept?"
2. **Stakeholder Relevance**: "Do business stakeholders care about this data?"
3. **Cross-Domain Applicability**: "Could this entity type exist in other business domains?"
4. **Operational Impact**: "Would removing this data disrupt business operations?"
5. **Real-World Existence**: "Does this represent something that exists outside the software system?"
6. **Business Decision Support**: "Is this data used to make business decisions?"
7. **Persona Completeness**: "Have I identified entities for ALL types of people who interact with this system?"
8. **Key Field Validation**: "Are primary keys and foreign keys clearly identified and documented in the data structure table?"
9. **Relationship Field Mapping**: "Are the specific field names that connect related entities documented with 'Linked via' mappings?"
10. **Field Connection Accuracy**: "Do the field mappings accurately reflect the actual foreign key relationships in the source code?"

**Note on Entity Category Mapping**: Research across healthcare, manufacturing, retail, insurance, and other verticals confirms that additional categories like locations, processes, resources, and temporal entities can be effectively mapped to the core 5-category framework:
- **Locations/Places** → METADATA (business classifications)
- **Processes/Workflows** → Interactions between PERSONAS, OBJECTS, and EVENTS
- **Resources/Assets** → OBJECTS (business assets)
- **Temporal/Time-based** → EVENTS (business activities)
- **Hierarchical/Organizational** → OBJECTS or METADATA (business structures)

## Output Requirements

### Primary Deliverables

1. **Universal Business Entity Catalog** (business-entities.md):

```markdown
### ENTITY-[###]: [Business Entity Name]

**Entity Type**: [Persona/Object/Event/Metadata/Relationship]
**Business Domain**: [Specific business area this entity serves]
**Description**: [Business purpose and meaning in domain context]
**Source**: [Copybook/DCLGEN/Program, lines ###-###]

**Business Attributes**:
- Primary Key: [Unique identifier fields]
- Core Attributes: [Essential business data fields]
- Foreign Keys: [Relationship fields to other entities]
- Status Fields: [Business status and control fields]

**Data Structure**:
| Field Name | Data Type | Length | Description | Key Type |

| FIELD-NAME | PIC 9(##) | ## | Business field description | Foreign Key |
| FIELD-NAME | PIC S9(##)V99 | ## | Business field description | |

**Relationships**:
- Parent: [Entities this depends on with cardinality]
  - Linked via: [Foreign Key field] → [Primary Key field]
- Children: [Entities depending on this with cardinality]
  - Linked via: [Primary Key field] → [Foreign Key field]
- Associates: [Related business entities]
  - Linked via: [Primary Key field] → [Foreign Key field]

**Usage Context**:
- Programs: [Programs using this entity]
- Business Functions: [Business processes involving this entity]
- Business Rules: [Domain-specific rules governing this entity]

**Combined Entity Relationship**:
- This is a one time data at the end of the report depicting relationship accross all entities.
- Collects the **Relationships** from each entity combine it into one single form
- Make sure to use mermaid syntax to depict the relationships and cardinality indicators`.
```

The output file should be added to the 01.phase-1-output folder as a PR to the attached github repo.
