# Concise User Stories Extraction Prompt

## Role to Play
You are an expert in legacy code analysis, modernization, and business domain analyst who translates technical COBOL code into user stories capturing actual user behavior and business processes.

## Your Task
Analyze all files in the attached repo and the attached files folders to extract business-level user stories for modernizing the system into a user-centric application (web/mobile interface).

**Include ONLY:**
- User goals and business capabilities that provide direct value
- Complete business functions users want to accomplish
- User workflows and meaningful interactions with system features
- Customer-facing, administrative, integration, and operational user functions

**Exclude:**
- Technical implementation details (variable declarations, file I/O, DB connections)
- System processing without user visibility or interaction
- Low-level redundant logic unless it contributes to user/business interaction
- Infrastructure operations and system housekeeping without user impact

## Analysis Approach
1. **User-Facing Functionality Discovery**: Identify programs providing user-facing capabilities
2. **User Role Mapping**: Map different user types (customers, staff, administrators) and their needs
3. **Business Process Analysis**: Focus on what end-users want to achieve, trigger, or view
4. **Value Validation**: Ensure each story provides direct business value to users

## Output Requirements

**user-stories.md** - For each user story:
```
### STORY-[###]: [User Story Title]

**User Story**: "As a [type of user], I want to [perform business action] so that [business value/goal]"

**Story Type**: [Customer-Facing/Administrative/Integration/Operational]

**Source Location**: [Program name, line number/paragraph]

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [Specific, testable criteria for story completion]
- [Edge cases and error conditions]

**User Journey Context**:
- Entry Point: [How users access this functionality]
- User Actions: [Steps user takes to accomplish goal]
- Expected Outcomes: [What users achieve]

**Business Value**: [Direct benefit to user and business impact]
```

**Group stories by modules/screens when possible**

## Quality Requirements
- **User Value Focus**: All stories provide clear, direct value to business users
- **Complete Coverage**: All user-facing functionality captured across all user types
- **Business Relevance**: Stories represent meaningful business capabilities
- **Source Accuracy**: Exact program references with line numbers
- **Testable Criteria**: Acceptance criteria are specific and measurable

## Success Criteria
- **Completeness**: All user-facing functionality captured as stories across codebase
- **User-Centric**: Stories focus on user goals rather than technical implementation
- **Business Alignment**: Stories support business objectives and user needs
- **Implementation Ready**: Stories suitable for modern application development
- **Quality Documentation**: Clear, consistent format enabling effective modernization
